### Types
1. One-compartment Boiler (the most simple type)
	for small to medium size hydrogen plants
	Tube sheet have to be thin so water can cool them
	TYPICAL OPERATING CONDITIONS
		Gas flow, kmol/h 2900 
		Gas composition, Mol % H2 51 
		 H2O 27 
		 CO 15 
		 CO2 6 
		 CH4 1 
		Gas pressure, 20  bar
		Gas inlet temperature, 910 c

2. Two-compartment Boiler (for heat transfer optimization of large boilers) 
3. Double Tube Bundle Boiler (for control of outlet temperature)


### Good Praxis for Design of HTAS RG WHB 
- Tube length must not exceed 7 m 
- Tubes will normally be cheapest in inch size (however, this is not mandatory) 
- The smallest acceptable tube size is 11/4 inch. 
- Tube wall thickness must be larger than 3 mm. 
- Tube surface roughness is specified to 0.04 mm. 
- Tube pitch is preferably rotated triangular. 
- The tube pitch must be larger than 1.5 * Tube OD. 
- There must be an annular space larger than 150 mm between tube bundle and shell 
- The maximum heat flux must respect the indication in HEATEX. It should not exceed 
300.000 – 400.000 kcal/m2/h. 
- Fouling resistance on shell side will normally be 0.0001 (Kcal/m2/h/oC)-1 
- Fouling resistance on tube side will normally be 0.0004 – 0.0006 (Kcal/m2/h/oC)-1 
- If metal tube side surface temperatures exceed 400oC, protection against metal dusting 
has to be included. This can be by an Inconel 601 tube lining. 
 NB! The HEATEX-calculated surface temperatures cannot be used for this evalua-
tion because it refers to clean conditions. 
- The shell inner diameter should not exceed 3.3 m
