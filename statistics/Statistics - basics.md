# basic operation in statistics

### types of data
1. [[Population]]
2. [[samples]]

to find the population mean and variance we approx from samples as followed

> A sample mean is a best estimate of population mean **BUT not in case of variance**
<br>
### it can be proved that sample estimated variance of a population

$$
s^2 = \sum ^n \frac{(x-\overline x)^2}{n-1}
$$
or we can use this form here
$$
s^2 = \frac{n}{n-1}.\overline{\sigma ^2}
$$

<br>

# remember $s^2$ is sample estimated variance of population
#sampleEstimatedPopulationVariance

now  i know what is sample and population we can continue to interesting tricks [[variance of mean in population]]
